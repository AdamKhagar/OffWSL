turn off your wsl enviroment

Hi, do you like WSL? Me too, but there is one thing which i dont like about it. To turn it off you need open the console and type ```wsl.exe --shutdown```.It's not that hard but it takes time. So I decided to make simple script which will do it for me and turn it into .exe
