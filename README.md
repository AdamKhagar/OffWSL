# OffWSL
turn off your wsl enviroment

Hi, do you like WSL? Me too, but there is one thing which i dont like about it. To turn it off you need open the console and type ```wsl.exe --shutdown```.It's not that hard but it takes time. So I decided to make simple script which will do it for me and turn it into .exe


You can use .exe file or generate it with `auto-py-to-exe` in case if you dont trust me:)

## How to generate .exe
1. Install requirements from requirements.txt
2. Run ```auto-py-to-exe``` in console
3. Use GUI to generate .exe file
